This is a basic boiler plate to get a redux with react and babel session started.  It is bare.

Once you have this repo cloned or downloaded you will need to run:
```
npm install --save youtube-api-search
npm install --save lodash
```
This app requries the two above libraries outside the normal npm install

Then run the commands:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```
and you can then find the app / webpage on localhost:8080

This was forked from [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider) and you can find a react course of his [here](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)
